## How to run
To run the application, open a terminal in the main repository and do
```make run```

## Getting started
To use Usuku, simply open the app and create a user account by entering a username and password and clicking on Sign in. In future sessions you can login to that account by using the Login button. As your account and your entries are saved locally, you can only login from the device on which you created the account.
Note that there is no option for account recovery, which means that your data is lost if you forget your login data or your local drive is damaged.
